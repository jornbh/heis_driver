The user is responsible for not giving stupid input, or polling nonexistent buttons API: Functions {:ok, driver_pid} = Driver.start_link button_pressed?(floor, button_direction) set_motor_dir(motor_direction) set_button_light(floor, button_direction, on_or_off) set_floor_indicator(floor) set_door_state(door_state) Data-types door_state: (:opne/:closed) motor_direction: (:hall_up/:hall_down/:cab) floor: (0/1/.../number_of_floors -1) door_state: :open/:closed Further reading GenServers are a really neat way to make servers without having to rewrite the same code all the time. It works Exactly the same in erlang as well, but it is called gen_server instead. The erlang documentation is kind of hard understand, so use the elixir-video and &quot;Translate&quot; it to erlang (gen_server:call(...) instead of GenServer.call(...)). Short version is that a GenServer implements the basic parts of a server, and the code seen in this file is the &quot;Blanks you have to fill in&quot; A youtube-video that explains GenServers and Supervisors https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EjRvaCOl94 Credits to Jostein for implementing this"},{"ref":"Driver.html#button_dir?/1","title":"Driver.button_dir?/1","type":"function","doc":""},{"ref":"Driver.html#button_pressed?/2","title":"Driver.button_pressed?/2","type":"function","doc":""},{"ref":"Driver.html#check_floor/0","title":"Driver.check_floor/0","type":"function","doc":""},{"ref":"Driver.html#child_spec/1","title":"Driver.child_spec/1","type":"function","doc":"Returns a specification to start this module under a supervisor.
