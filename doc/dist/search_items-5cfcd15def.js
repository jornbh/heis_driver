It works Exactly the same in erlang as well, but it is called gen_server instead. The erlang documentation is kind of hard understand, so use the elixir-video and &quot;Translate&quot; it to erlang (gen_server:call(...) instead of GenServer.call(...)). Short version is that a GenServer implements the basic parts of a server, and the code seen in this file is the &quot;Blanks you have to fill in&quot; A youtube-video that explains GenServers and Supervisors https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EjRvaCOl94"},{"ref":"Driver.html#button_dir?/1","title":"Driver.button_dir?/1","type":"function","doc":""},{"ref":"Driver.html#button_pressed?/2","title":"Driver.button_pressed?/2","type":"function","doc":""},{"ref":"Driver.html#check_floor/0","title":"Driver.check_floor/0","type":"function","doc":""},{"ref":"Driver.html#child_spec/1","title":"Driver.child_spec/1","type":"function","doc":"Returns a specification to start this module under a supervisor.
